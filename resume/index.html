(Aug 2006 &ndash; Jul 2007)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Here, I worked on project &nbsp;Liveta &nbsp; - a speech recognition and verification project which helped non-native speakers learn a language and aimed at making them achieve native proficiency in it. My work involved research and study on speech verification systems as well as development and optimization of &nbsp;speech recognition systems based on Hidden Markov Process &nbsp;of &nbsp;tri-phone based cepstral models. Programming was done using C/C++ and &nbsp;Linux Multimedia APIs and on ARM processors. I also worked on project Enlite which is a Microsoft Office 2007 simulation. I was responsible for developing new application extensions which used complex state machines to drive learning and user experiance. This &nbsp;project involved intensive programming using MFC and Windows API.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4 c3">Education</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, USA.
